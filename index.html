        I grew up in a small town in Wisconsin and spent a lot of time outdoors.
        by the time I was in highschool I was playing computer games quite a lot and 
        built my first computer when I was a freshmen. After graduating I spent a few
        years traveling and working on a National Geographic expedition ship. When life
        at sea started to get old I decided to to get a degree in Computer Science. I am 
        currently working to complete that degree and will be graduating in early 2021.
